Parts of the mutant’s body are covered with prickly spines,
which may be small, medium, or large. Roll 1d6 at
character generation to determine the size. Small spines
(1-2) inflict 1d4 damage, medium spines (3-4) inflict 1d6,
and large spines (5-6) are capable of inflicting 1d8
damage. Any type can be removed and thrown as a
dagger. With a little effort, the small spines are capable of
being hidden beneath normal clothing, but the medium
and large spines are virtually impossible to conceal
because of their size.
