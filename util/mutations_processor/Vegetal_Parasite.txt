If the plant can attack and latch onto another creature for
3 rounds (one successful attack roll for three consecutive
rounds), it will maintain control over the creature as long
as the two are in physical contact. Plants will usually use
these controlled bodies for protection or food, and a plant
may control as many creatures as it has limbs to touch
them.
