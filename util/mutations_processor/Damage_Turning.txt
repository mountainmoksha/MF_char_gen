This mutation allows the character to return any incoming
damage to the origin of the attack. For this power to work
the mutant must use every bit of his concentration, taking
no other actions. Any movement of more than one or two
small steps will cause this power to fail.|
The power gradually builds up, allowing 3d6 hp worth of
damage to be turned the first round. This increases by 1d6
per round up to a maximum of 20d6 hp worth of damage.
The mutant only takes damage that is above his current hp
level of damage turning. For instance, in the first round the
character rolls 3d6, with a result of 14. He may turn up to
14 hp of damage the first round. The next round he adds
1d6 to the current running total of 14. He can keep the
power working as long as he remains still and
concentrating, and he may maintain concentration when
he receives damage. The mutant cannot turn attacks that
cause no damage. If such powers are successful, they can
interfere with this ability.
