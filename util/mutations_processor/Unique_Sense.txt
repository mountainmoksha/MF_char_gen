The mutant with a unique sense may detect certain kinds
of phenomenon that are not detectable by the usual
senses. These might include the ability to “feel” radiation
to a distance of 60’, “smell” water within a mile, or sense
when certain kinds of weather are imminent. The player
and Mutant Lord may devise an appropriate sense, and
what its range will be. Some senses may have
corresponding new organs.
