This mutation grants the power to visit realities in other
dimensions. These dimensions are accessed through
temporary doors which the mutant creates using the power
of his mind. These doors appear as large portals 10’x10’
in size, and will last for 6 rounds or until the mutant closes
them intentionally. Once entered, they cannot be exited
without a mutant with this ability opening another door.
The mutant can only choose to open doors to worlds he
has visited before. Otherwise, the doorway leads to a
random world of the ML’s choice and design. This ability
only works once per week.
