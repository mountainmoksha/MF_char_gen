The character has a second brain that hinders his thought
processes. This brain has 1d4 mental mutations of its own
(half of which should be defects, round up), which should
be kept secret from the player until an opportunity to
discover them comes about during play. This second brain
may have an entirely different personality and motives than
the character, and may try to foil the character’s actions at
inconvenient times. This is up to the ML’s discretion. This
“Hyde” brain may attempt to take over the mutant’s body,
as the mutation possession, once per month for a duration
of 24 hours.
