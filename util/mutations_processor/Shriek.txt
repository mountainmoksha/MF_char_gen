The mutant’s vocal cords are substantially altered,
allowing him to produce sounds both above and below
the normal human auditory range. The culmination of this
ability seems to be a focused shout, using the sonic
vibrations on everyone in the immediate vicinity of the
mutant.|
Once per day, the mutant can let out a horrible shriek that
affects everyone within a 10’ radius of him. Targets in the
area of effect must save versus stun attacks or take 1d4
points of sonic damage and be deafened for 1d6+4
rounds. Those who successfully save are unaffected.
Mutants with the mutation echolocation suffer a -2 penalty
to save.
