The mutant is capable of seeing up to 3 minutes into the
future, but only with respect to dangerous things that will
affect him. If the future indicates that he is going to suffer
some form of damage, he immediately suffers 1d6 hp
damage. If he is confronted with a vision of his death or of
suffering a grievous wound that would take more than 1‚ÅÑ2
of his hit points, he suffers 2d6 hp damage and
immediately enters a comatose state lasting 1 turn.
