Mutated genes have altered the mutant’s physical size, an effect
either related to a pituitary defect or a change in the genetic
program during the years of body growth and development. With
this mutation, the mutant is a dwarf, a mutant with substantially
decreased size and body weight.|
To figure out the character’s size, start with a base of 6 feet.
Roll 1d4+1 and subtract the result from 6 to get the height of the
character in feet.  This will give a range from 1 and 4 feet.|
The character’s diminutive size makes it harder to damage opponents,
but also makes it more difficult for opponents to land successful
blows on the mutant, since he presents such a small target. A
dwarf mutant has a +1 to hit targets of human sized or larger
with a non-powered hand weapon.|
He does -1 to damage for every 1’ shorter than he is from
3 feet, with an equal reduction (improvement) of AC for
each foot he is shorter than 3’.
