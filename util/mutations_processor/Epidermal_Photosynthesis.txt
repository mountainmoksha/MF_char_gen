Characters with this mutation get energy from the sun,
processing it through their bodies as though it were food.
If they spend long periods of inactivity in direct sunlight,
they will be able to heal wounds more quickly (4x) than the
regular healing rate (1d3 per day of complete rest). When
they are out of the sun (i.e. at night or in a dark cave) they
are forced to move more slowly in order to conserve their
rapidly depleting energy. This reduces their movement to
50% of the normal rate. Such characters are also more
susceptible to cold and heat, and they suffer a â€“2 penalty
to saving throws versus cold or heat based energy attacks.
