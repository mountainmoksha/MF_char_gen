The character is endowed with a weapon that is toxic to
those affected by it. This could be in the form of a gas that
affects everyone in a specific radius, a spray that can affect
a specific target, or a bite/sting that affects a target at a
range of touch. Some common types of toxic weapons are
paralyzing venoms, blinding gasses or sprays, and acidic
bodily fluids. The range or radius of the attack is up to
30â€™. Any kind of poison must be rolled on the poison table
in the Adventuring section to determine poison class at
character generation, or alternative effects may be
designed with the ML. In general, no attack should exceed
10d6 in damage (with the exception of poisons that may
inflict death).
