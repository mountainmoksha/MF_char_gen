Mutated genes have altered the mutant’s
physical size, an effect either related to a
pituitary defect or a change in the genetic
program during the years of body
growth and development. With this
mutation, the mutant is a dwarf, a
mutant with substantially decreased
size and body weight.|
To figure out the character’s size, start
with a base of 6 feet. Roll 1d4+1
and subtract the result from 6 to get
the height of the character in feet.
This will give a range from 1 and 4
feet.|
The character’s diminutive size makes
it harder to damage opponents, but
also makes it more difficult for opponents to land
successful blows on the mutant, since he presents such a
small target. A dwarf mutant has a +1 to hit targets of
human sized or larger with a non-powered hand weapon.
He does -1 to damage for every 1’ shorter than he is from
3 feet, with an equal reduction (improvement) of AC for
each foot he is shorter than 3’.
