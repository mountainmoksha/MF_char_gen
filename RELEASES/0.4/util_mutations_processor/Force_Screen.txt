This mutation allows the character to create an invisible
field of energy that is difficult to penetrate. The force
screen is close to the mutantâ€™s body, extending only a few
inches from his skin. It is capable of taking 5d6 hp worth
of damage (the ML determines this secretly each time the
power is used) before it collapses, leaving the mutant
unprotected. The power may only be used once per day.
