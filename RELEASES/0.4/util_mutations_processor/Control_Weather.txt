The mutant can change the weather in the local area. It
takes 1 round to use the mutation and an additional 1d4
rounds for the effects to manifest. The mutant calls forth
weather appropriate to the climate and season of the
area.|
Possible Weather:|
Spring = Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or
hot weather|
Summer = Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm|
Autumn = Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet|
Winter = Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw|
Late winter = Hurricane-force winds or early spring
(coastal area)|
The mutant controls the general tendencies of the weather,
such as the direction and intensity of the wind, but cannot
control specific applications of the weather-where lightning
strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado.
Contradictory weather conditions are not possible
simultaneously. Control weather can do away with
atmospheric phenomena (naturally occurring or otherwise)
as well as create them.
