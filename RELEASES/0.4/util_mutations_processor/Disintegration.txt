With this powerful mutation, the mutant can completely
destroy matter on a molecular level. Doing so requires so
much energy expenditure, however, that the mutant is
instantly rendered unconscious, with 1 hp left. The total
weight that may be disintegrated is WILx10 pounds and
the range is 90 feet.|
It is more difficult to disintegrate dense materials. Multiply
the mutantâ€™s WIL by 3 to find the percentage chance of
disintegrating metals and stone, or by 5 to figure out the
percentage chance of disintegrating wood or living
material.|
Once the mutant has used this power, the ML must
determine, via a secret 1d6 roll, how many days it will be
before the power may be used another time.
