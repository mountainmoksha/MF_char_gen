This defect creates a chance that mental attacks attempted
by the mutant backfire, causing injury to him instead of his
enemy. The chance of this occurring is 25%.|
In the case of powers that inflict no damage, the Mutant
Lord should find some way to make the power backfire or
become an inconvenience to the character.
