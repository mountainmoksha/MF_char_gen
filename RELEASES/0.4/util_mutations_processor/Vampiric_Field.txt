This mutation grants the mutant the ability to absorb the
life essence (hit points) from all creatures (friend or foe)
within a foot radius equal to 30+WIL. This power absorbs
2d4 hp per round from all creatures in the radius, and
these absorbed points go into a separate reserve for the
mutant. All damage to the mutant is taken from these
reserved points until they are gone; after this point the
mutantâ€™s regular hp begin to be affected. Stored hp will
disappear after 24 hours.
