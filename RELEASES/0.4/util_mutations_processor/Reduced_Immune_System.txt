Whenever the character falls ill, whether it is from infection
caused by combat/misadventure, or airborne infectious
diseases, the character suffers an extra 10 hp of damage
per day. If using the optional Disease rules characters with
this mutation suffer a -4 saving throw adjustment against
diseases, and the duration is doubled.
