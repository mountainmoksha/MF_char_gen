This defect indicates the pituitary gland of the mutant has
been deformed by mutation, causing unnatural aging.|
A character with this defect appears much older than he
really is, generally two to three times his actual age.
Lifespan is also hindered by this deformation, resulting in a
maximum natural lifespan of 40-50 years.
