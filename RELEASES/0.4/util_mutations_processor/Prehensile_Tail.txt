The mutant has developed a special tail. The tail is not
necessarily a balancing tool, but more of an “additional
limb”.|
The tail can grapple objects like a hand (much like a new
world monkey’s tail), allowing the mutant to hang from
tree limbs, for instance, leaving the arms and legs free to
perform other actions of a more complex and agile
nature. Some typical bonuses granted by the mutation
might be a +2 bonus to Dexterity checks when climbing or
balancing (+4 if climbing trees), etc. The tail can also be
used in more mundane ways, such as holding a light
source, so the character can employ both hands to fight.
The tail cannot use weapons or hold a shield, however, as
it is not quite that dexterous.
