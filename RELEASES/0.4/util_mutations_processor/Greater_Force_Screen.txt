This force screen can be used at a range of 4â€™, and is
capable of enclosing other creatures. It can take 5d6 hp
worth of damage before it collapses (the ML determines
this secretly each time the power is used), and can be used
once per day. It can also be employed in the same
manner as the regular force screen.
