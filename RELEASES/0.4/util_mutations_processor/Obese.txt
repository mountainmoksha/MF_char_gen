The character suffers from obesity, and his weight is twice 
that of an average individual of his species. The ML may 
apply encumbrance or combat modifiers when it seems as 
though the characterâ€™s size would interfere with his abilities 
in any way. It is also possible to choose one body location 
and declare that the fat accumulates there, giving one or 
more limbs a grotesque, bloated shape compared to that 
of the rest of the body.
