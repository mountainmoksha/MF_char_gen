Through years of exposure to a certain substance
(chemicals or radiation, for instance), or concentrated
form of energy (such as heat, cold, or light) in the mutant’s
environment, a resistance against said source has been
accumulated, allowing the mutant to take more damage
from one of these sources.|
This mutation gives the mutant a hit point reserve equal to
his total hit points. This hit point reserve is used to take
damage from the substance he is resistant to before it
begins to affect his regular pool of hit points. This separate
pool heals in the same manner and at the same time as
the character’s hit point pool, even if that rate is changed
by other mutations such as acute hyper healing or body
adjustment.
