The plant is capable of generating a ray of heat or cold
(50%) capable of doing 4d6 damage to those it comes in
contact with. Depending on the size of the plant, it may
have 1d3 heat or cold emitting flowers or branches. The
range of this attack is 50 feet. The ML may determine if
there is a difference between intelligent plants and other
plants with regard to this power. A suggested difference is
a -2 attack adjustment for plants with no higher order
mental functions.
