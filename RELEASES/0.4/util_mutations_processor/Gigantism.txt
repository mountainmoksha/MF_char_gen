Mutated genes have altered the mutant’s physical size, an
effect either related to a pituitary defect or a change in the
genetic program during the years of body growth and
development. While this serves to increase strength and
size potential substantially, the mutant is nonetheless
noticeably different than others of his species.|
The original size is based on a 6 foot height. Roll 3d6,
adding that many feet to the size of the mutant, achieving
sizes between 9 and 24 feet. The mutant gets a bonus to
damage, based on his height. Note that all mutants with
gigantism suffer a -1 penalty to hit creatures 3’ tall or
smaller.|
Damage Dice Bonus: Height 9’ = +1, 12’ = +2, 18’ = +3, 24’ = +4|
*The Damage Dice Bonus is only applicable to non-powered
hand weapons.
