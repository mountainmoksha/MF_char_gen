This mutation indicates that the character has grown a
natural defense mechanism over the entire body. It can be
thick fur, scales, a shell, or even rubbery skin. This armor
is moderate (1-3 on 1d6) or extreme (4-6 on 1d6).
Moderate armor grants an AC of 6, while extreme natural
armor grants an AC of 4, but reduces movement to 75%
of its regular rate.
