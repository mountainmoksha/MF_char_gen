The epidermis of the mutant becomes defective in some
way, either causing 1d6 hp of damage for coming into
contact with usually harmless substances (such as water),
or adding +1 per die of damage caused by specific injury,
such as by fire, radiation, slashing weapons, or
penetrating weapons.
The mutation can also be something that constantly
creates a serious inconvenience for the character, such as
glowing skin, uncontrollable pigment shifting, or skin that
always attracts certain kinds of vermin or larger creatures.
