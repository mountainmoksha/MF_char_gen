This drawback requires the character to eat twice the 
normal amount of food daily. During times of vigorous 
activity, this need becomes more acute. For every 5 rounds 
of vigorous activity, the character must eat for 1 round or 
lose 2 hit points and 1 point of STR each melee round 
until he eats again or until the activity stops. All losses will 
be regained at an equal rate for each round that food is 
consumed, until all loss of hit points and STR is regained.
