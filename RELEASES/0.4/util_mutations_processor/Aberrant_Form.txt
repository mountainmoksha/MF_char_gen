This mutation covers a wide array of effects over the entire
bodily structure of the mutant. Roll 1d8 to determine the
nature of the mutation.|
1-2 Enlarged Parts: Some aspect of the mutantâ€™s body has
grown to an abnormally large size and, as a result, has
increased functionality. Because this is a benefit all limbs
and organs are assumed to be affected in concert (i.e.
both arms, both legs, etc.). For example, this mutation
could manifest as a +1, +2, or +3 to damage if arms
are larger than normal, or +60 to movement for longer or
larger legs.|
3-4 Xenomorphism: The character gains a unique
organ/limb with a new function, such as an extra pair of
eyes on stalks, a prehensile proboscis, a limb or body part
from another species, or a set of tentacles that act as extra
arms. An extra body part from another species may (50%)
be equipped with a natural weapon.|
5-6 Extra Parts: Any organ or limb that is normally present
may be multiplied. An extra normal organ (extra heart,
extra set of lungs) may be acquired, which could increase
CON by +1. To generate a random number of a given
body part roll 1d4+1 and multiply by that number, or a
number may be selected. The brain and/or head cannot
be duplicated by this mutation. The body part must be
selected at character generation.|
7-8 Natural Weapon: The mutant is equipped with a
natural weapon, such as horns, teeth, or claws (select at
character creation). These will inflict damage as
determined by rolling 1d8; 1-2 1d4, 3-4 1d6, 5-6 1d8,
7-8 1d10. The character may only attack once per round
with a natural weapon, unless he possesses more than one
attack per round. A natural weapon may (25%) be
equipped with a toxic weapon, such as poison.
