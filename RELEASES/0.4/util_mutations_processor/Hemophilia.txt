The mutantâ€™s white blood cells are diminished in count, 
preventing him from healing as quickly as a normal 
specimen of his kind. This mutant may only heal 1d3 hp 
every other day. Once the character is injured, he begins 
to bleed profusely, losing 2 hit points per round until the 
wounds can be properly bandaged.
