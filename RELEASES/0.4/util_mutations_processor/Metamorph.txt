The character can choose (at character creation) another
creature that he or she can transform into. The character
does not gain the mutations of the creature, just the
physical appearance and natural abilities (such as claws or
sharp teeth). This physical change (in either direction)
takes 2 full rounds of inactivity before it is complete.
