These tendrils have a very low strength (1d4), and are
capable of only very slow movement. Given enough time,
however, they can crush a small or weakened creature in
their grasp. Once in position, without resistance, they may
inflict 1d6 hp damage per round. The plant usually grows
a large patch (2d10 feet in diameter) of these vines to trip
victims. Victims who fall unconscious on vines such as
these are not likely to waken.
