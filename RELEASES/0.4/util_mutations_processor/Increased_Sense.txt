One or more senses is very acute, allowing the mutant to
sense things others may not. Roll 1d10 to determine the
sense.|
1-2 Increased Vision: This allows the mutant to see things
as far as 3 miles away if there is a clear line of sight. This
mutation comes with the benefit of ultraviolet vision and
night vision.|
3-4 Increased Hearing: A character may distinguish even
the quietest sounds at a range of 180 feet. This also
allows the mutant to pick out sounds from a jumble of
noises. Mutants with increased hearing cannot be
surprised because they will always hear any movement in
their vicinity, and they can listen at a door with success on
a roll of 1-5 on 1d6.|
5-6 Increased Smell: A mutant with this mutation can pick
up scents at 180 feet and tell the difference between
various smells even if some seem overwhelming to others.
Creatures that are upwind can never surprise this
character.|
7-8 Increased Touch: This increased sense grants +10%
to technology rolls.|
9-10 Increased Taste: This ability does not have a range,
but it ensures that a character cannot be poisoned and will
always be able to tell by tasting whether something is
capable of being eaten for nourishment.
