The character can see the heat generated by living beings,
heat-emitting weapons, or other natural heat sources. This
vision functions to a distance of 60’ if the mutant has
ordinary vision as well, or to 90’ if thermal vision is the
only form of sight the mutant possesses (the eyes emit
infrared radiation to boost the distance). If a mutant has
ordinary vision and thermal vision, the thermal vision is
only usable in darkness, and it takes 1 round to transition
between them. Immense flashes of heat or those coming
from close proximity to the character can be
overwhelming, blinding the character for 2d4 rounds.
