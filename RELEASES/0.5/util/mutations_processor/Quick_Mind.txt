The mutant is capable of learning how to use technology
at a much higher rate of speed than other characters (in
1/3 the time), and receives a bonus of 30% to technology
rolls. When confronted with a mental attack, an attacker
must roll to attack three times, succeeding each time (roll
three times for the one attack). Because of his incredible
leaps of logic, a mutant with this ability has a 100%
chance of figuring out whether someone is telling the truth.
