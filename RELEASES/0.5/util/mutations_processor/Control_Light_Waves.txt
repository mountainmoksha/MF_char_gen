The character can control light, creating a number of
interesting effects. He can bend light around himself,
becoming invisible, or he may remove all light from a
small area (10’ radius) at a range of 30 feet. He may also
completely dissipate laser fire anywhere within this 30’
range. All of these effects require concentration, such that
the mutant may move at full speed but not attack when
concentrating on using this mutation.
