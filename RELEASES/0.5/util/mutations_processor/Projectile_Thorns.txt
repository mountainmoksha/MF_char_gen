The plant is endowed with a substantial number of thorns.
These thorns are capable of being thrown if the plant has
mobility and any level of intelligence. The throwing range
of these thorns is like a dagger, and they deal 1d4 hp
damage if they strike a creature. Some plants (50%) grow
thorns that are covered with toxins. Determine the class of
the poison randomly.
