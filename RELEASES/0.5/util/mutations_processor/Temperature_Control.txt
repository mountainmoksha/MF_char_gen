With this mutation, the character can raise or lower the
temperature of a visible object within a range of 90 feet.
The specific form of the power must be determined at
character generation (50% heat, 50% cold). The mental
nature of this mutation requires concentration, and the
effect is a graduated level of damage equaling 1d6 per
round. The maximum amount of damage that can be
dealt is 10d6 per round. The ML will decide when an
object or being combusts or freezes completely.
