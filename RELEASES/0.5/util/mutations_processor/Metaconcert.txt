This ability allows the mutant to link its mind with other
mutants of a similar type or those who have the same
mental mutation. These include those with the
Metaconcert mutation, or other mental mutations that
facilitate control between the minds of two beings. The
mutant may combine his WIL with the WIL of other mutants
for conducting a mental attack, or some other joint
purpose.
