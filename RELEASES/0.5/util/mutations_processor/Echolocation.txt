The mutant has the ability to gather information on his
surroundings by using a type of natural sonar. The mutant
must emit a noise (some kind of clicking or speech will
do), which then reverberates off of the surface of any
surrounding objects or creatures, is picked up by an
external sense organ and translated into a rough, colorless
picture of all objects in the mutantâ€™s surroundings. This
allows the character to interact with the surroundings as if
he has sight, even if he does not have eyes or regular sight
is obscured. This does not allow the mutant to see through
objects, nor will it allow him to read text or see pictures.
This works for a range of 90 feet, or 270 feet if the
character also has the increased hearing mutation.
Mutants with this ability will have a better chance of
striking an opponent, receiving a +2 to hit in combat.
