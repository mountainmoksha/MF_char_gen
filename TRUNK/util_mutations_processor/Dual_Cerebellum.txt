The character has 2 fully functional brains that work in
concert. The mutant receives a bonus of 10% to all
technology rolls, and the character receives one extra
random mental mutation that belongs to the extra brain.
Both brains have identical WIL. Having two brains also
helps to protect the mutant from mental attacks. Whenever
the character is the subject of a mental attack, the attacker
must successfully attack each brain.|
Note that a character with two brains may or may not
have two heads. One brain may be located in an
unexpected part of the body, or as part of a small, sickly
or undeveloped conjoined twin.
