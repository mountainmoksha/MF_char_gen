The mutant has the ability to produce a subtle yet hypnotic
fragrance. The fragrance is generally derived from
mutated pheromones/hormones (that are emitted at the
mutantâ€™s will), but could come in another form-spores, for
instance. Once per day the mutant can emit a scent that
forces up to 8 HD of creatures, or any single creature with
less than 13 HD (or 13 CON) within 15 feet to save versus
poison or fall into a hypnotic trance for 2d4 rounds.
Victims may be ordered to commit any act that is not
suicidal, up to and including attacking friends.
