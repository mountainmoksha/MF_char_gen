Whenever a plant with this mutation is damaged, it gives
off a piercing shriek that is capable of damaging everyone
within a 30â€™ radius. This strange attack does not harm
other similar plants. The shriek causes 3d6 damage (save
versus stun attacks for half), and may be used every 4
rounds until the plant is killed. Mutants with the
echolocation mutation suffer a -2 penalty to save. If a
large patch of these plants is injured all at once, such as
when they are trampled by large creatures or vehicles roll
3d10 for damage instead of 3d6. An intelligent plant may
use this ability every 4 rounds at will.
