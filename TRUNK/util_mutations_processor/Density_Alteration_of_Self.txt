This mutation grants the ability to instantly alter the body
density of a target, thus shrinking or enlarging, with
maximum enlargement up to twice the natural body size.
Each fraction of a body size change is accompanied by an
equal fraction increase or decrease to armor class and
speed. For example, reduction of size by 1/4 also reduces
(improves) armor class and movement by 1/4. Becoming
twice as large increases armor class by a multiple of two
(to a maximum of 10) and divides movement in half as
well. Note that reduction of body density to 1/8 makes a
character impervious to damage from sharp implements.|
This mutation has a range of 90 feet, a duration of 1d4
turns, and cannot be used on the mutant who wields it.
