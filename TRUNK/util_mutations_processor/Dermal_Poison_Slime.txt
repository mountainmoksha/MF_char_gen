The mutant is covered in a thick gooey slime (like a frog)
that is poisonous to those who touch or attempt to ingest
the mutant. Roll on the poison table (see Adventuring
Rules) at character creation for the class of the poison in
the slime. Successful bare-hand attacks and bite attacks
against the mutant require the attacker to attempt a saving
throw versus poison. Bare-hand attacks made by the
mutant have the same effect.
