Individuals with this mutation can see in complete
darkness to a range of 60 feet by utilizing minute amounts
of available light. Vision is in black and white only, and
does not function in utter darkness underground, since
some small light must be present (starlight, moonlight),
even if it is so dim normal sight does not perceive it.
