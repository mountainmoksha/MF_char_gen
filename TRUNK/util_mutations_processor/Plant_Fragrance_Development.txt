The plant can send out a scent that is enticing to all living
creatures. This scent can be smelled for a range of up to 5
miles in windy conditions, or 90 feet in regular conditions.|
The enticing scent overwhelms any creature that fails a
saving throw versus poison. Every creature so enticed will
stay as close to the plant as possible and try to protect it,
even to the point of fighting other creatures that draw
near. Every 5 rounds anyone enticed by the plantâ€™s
fragrance may make another saving throw. Until the victim
is successful, he will stay near the plant until he dies from
severe dehydration or starvation.|
The scent itself deals no damage, but the plant may have
other mutations capable of doing so.
