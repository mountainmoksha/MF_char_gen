The character lacks the awareness that living creatures
normally possess with regard to their bodies and
immediate surroundings. The character does not feel pain
when injured, even if a weapon has penetrated his body.
The character will not be able to tell how much damage
he has sustained without making a visual checkup of his
entire body. The ML should keep track of the characterâ€™s
hit points.
