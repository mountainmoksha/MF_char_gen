This ability allows the mutant to disappear from one
location and appear in a location up to 20 miles distant
without physically crossing the intervening space. If the
mutant has never been to the location he is teleporting to
or is only slightly familiar with it (MLâ€™s discretion) he has a
25% chance of suffering 10d6 damage upon arrival as he
teleports into a space occupied by another object, or
misjudges some aspect of the location. If he is intimately
familiar with his destination or has spent 2d4 hours
conjuring an image of the location in his mind he can
teleport safely.
