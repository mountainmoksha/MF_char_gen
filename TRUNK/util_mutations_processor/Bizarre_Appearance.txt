This mutation can take a number of forms. The characterâ€™s
hair color, eye color, skin color (or any combination) can
be a color not normally found in humans. Odd hair colors
might be light red, unusually fair blond, white, platinum,
or silvery gray. Skin hues might include extensive freckling,
melanin blotches, irregularly livid tones, etc. Eye colors
could be red, pink, white, unusual flecked combinations
etc. Other mutations are possible, such as scales instead
of skin, general cosmetic deformity, or general animal-like
deformity. Whatever the abnormal condition, it is clear
that the character is not a normal human or animal.
