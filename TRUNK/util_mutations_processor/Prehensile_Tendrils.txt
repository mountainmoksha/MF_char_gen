These plant growths are capable of movement and a
rudimentary sense of touch. Prehensile tendrils come in
two forms, Simple and Constrictive. Roll 1d6:|
1-3 Simple tendrils: These have a randomly determined
(3d6) DEX and are capable of wielding weapons, but are
not strong enough to do damage on their own. Higher
DEX scores are due to aspects of the plant that make it
more dexterous, like sticky fibers and clingy cilia.|
4-6 Constrictive Tendrils: These tendrils can do 2d6
damage through constriction and are capable of rapid
movement. A successful attack roll achieves constriction,
and the victim will suffer damage on each consecutive
round.|
Because the growth pattern of such plants dictates that the
tendrils grow to full size quickly, even small plants with this
mutation are considered to have tendrils at least 10’ long,
and are capable of growing their tendrils to any length the
ML desires. To randomly determine the length of the
tendrils, simply multiply the base of 10’ by a roll of: 1d6
for small plants, 1d10 for medium sized plants, or 1d20
for large or tree sized plants. PCs with this mutation may
choose the length of their tendrils, but the length should
range from 10’ to 20’.
