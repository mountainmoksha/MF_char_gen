The mutantâ€™s outer cellular structure has been mutated,
allowing the cells to actually alter their lucidness,
appearance, and color. In effect, this allows the mutant to
subtly change colors on a cellular level. The being may
hide, if stationary, almost as if invisible. The color change
takes place immediately, and requires no concentration by
the mutant. The Mutant Lord should assign a percentage
chance, based on the situation, that the mutant will not be
noticed when using this camouflage. In complete darkness
or thick cover, the percentage could be 95%, while in
daylight if the character is unmoving it might be 50%.|
Characters wearing heavy armor or fully garbed
receive no benefit from Chameleon Epidermis.
