When provided with proper rest and food, this mutation
allows the character to recuperate from injury at a
staggering rate. Given time, mutants may re-grow severed
limbs.|
The character heals 10 extra hit points per day. If he
should be so unfortunate as to lose a limb or extremity
(and survive), the lost body part will regenerate over a
period of 1d4+2 weeks. A head may never be regrown,
and characters do not regenerate from death.
