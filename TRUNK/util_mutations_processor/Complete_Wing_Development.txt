The mutant has developed a
complete set of wings, either in the
form of fleshy membranes, feathery wings, bat-like
extremities, or even scaly or insect-like versions. With these
wings the character can fly with a movement of 120’. The
mutant may fly while carrying only 25% of his body weight.
Creatures over 150 pounds cannot use these wings for
flight, but they leap to a distance of 120’, with a maximum
height of 80’.
