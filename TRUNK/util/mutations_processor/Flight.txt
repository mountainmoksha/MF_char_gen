The plant has developed some way of coasting on strong
winds and, if the plant is intelligent, it may have actual
winged flight. The method of flight is up to the ML.
Perhaps the plant has grown special cupped leaves or a
series of light tubules that make it structurally capable of
flight. For winged flight by modified leaves, see complete
wing development for movement. Otherwise, the plantâ€™s
movement rate will be heavily dependent on wind speeds.
