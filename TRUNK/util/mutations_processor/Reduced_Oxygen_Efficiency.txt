This mutation makes it harder for the character to get
oxygen into the circulatory system. This means that, after
any amount of extended physical activity (including
combat) lasting more than 5 rounds, the character must
rest or fall unconscious for 3d6 rounds. Further, when
exploring ruins these characters need to rest for 1 turn
after 3 turns of exploration. See “Rest” in the Adventuring
Rules section.
