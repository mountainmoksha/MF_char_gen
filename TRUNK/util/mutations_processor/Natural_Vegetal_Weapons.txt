This mutation covers all types of aspects of a plant that
could generally be considered “natural”. This includes
things like large thorns (up to 12 inches), or sharp leaves
capable of cutting into flesh or clothing. While dangerous
on their own, these will generally only affect characters
that blunder into the plant unaware of its danger. When
such weapons are attached to plants that are capable of
attacking or moving their vines or limbs about, however,
they become very dangerous indeed.|
The types of weapons covered by Natural Vegetal
Weapons can do 1d4, 1d6, or 1d8 damage. Determine
randomly for PCs by rolling 1d6; 1-2 1d4; 3-4 1d6; 5-6
1d8. These weapons may have other effects decided by
the ML. They may be passive, or attached to mobile vines.
