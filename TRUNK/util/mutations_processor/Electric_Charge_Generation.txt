The plant can use some of the excess energy not converted
to food into a stored electrical charge capable of
damaging creatures that come in contact with it. This
electrical weapon does 4d6 hp damage, and must be
recharged. The plant will be fully charged again after four
rounds, and may deliver smaller shocks (non-damaging,
but uncomfortable) every round if under constant
harassment by predators or opponents.
