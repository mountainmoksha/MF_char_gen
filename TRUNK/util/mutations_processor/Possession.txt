The mutant may wrest control over another creatureâ€™s
body, subjecting himself to all of the sensations the
possessed creature experiences. If the creature dies while
possessed, the mutant dies as well. During the time he
possesses another body, the body of the mutant is
unconscious and vulnerable to attack. He may relinquish
control of the body at any time, and will return instantly to
his own body.|
This power works at a range of 50 feet, but once inside
another body the possessor can travel any distance with
no ill effects.
