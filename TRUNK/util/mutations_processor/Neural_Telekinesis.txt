With this mutation the character can lift or move WILx10
pounds using only the power of his mind. This ability does
not extend to lifting the mutant, however. To the mutant,
using this power feels like lifting the object with his
strength, and so requires some concentration. This ability
has a range of 50 feet, and can only be used to hold
things for 5 rounds before the mutant becomes tired and
must set the objects down. The mutant must rest for 5
rounds before using the power again.|
Any use of this mutation on another creature, or objects
carried by another creature, is considered a mental attack
and must be handled accordingly.
