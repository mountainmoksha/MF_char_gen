A mutant who suffers from this mutation has an altered
appearance that mimics that of the great apes (such as
gorillas and chimpanzees) - shorter legs, quadrupedal,
and elongated arms that permit the knuckles to touch the
ground and aid in movement.|
The characterâ€™s shortened legs reduce his base speed to
2/3 normal. However, if all 4 limbs are used to move
(arms and legs), his speed is normal. A character using his
arms to assist movement cannot be wielding a weapon or
carrying items in his hands.
