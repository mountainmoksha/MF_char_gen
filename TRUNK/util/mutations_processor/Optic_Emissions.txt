This mutation takes two forms. Roll 1d6, and on a roll of
1-3 the mutant character receives the ability to project a
flash of very bright light from the eyes (bright eyes),
blinding an opponent within 30’ for 1d4 rounds. This
blindness causes the opponent a penalty of -4 to attack
rolls and increases his armor class by 4. This ability is
useful regardless of daytime or nighttime. On a roll of 4-6,
the character has the ability to discharge a burst of
radiation from the eyes (gamma eyes), that can reach 30’.
Damage is determined at character creation by rolling for
the class of the radiation on the radiation table in the
Adventuring section.
