The mutant may reflect any mental attack he experiences
back at the attacker, but he still suffers the effects of the
attack. He may only reflect a power that he has been
successfully stricken by, and only as many times as he has
been stricken by it. The reflected power strikes the mind of
the attacker, and it can never target any other creature.
