The character can see the UV spectrum and will be able to
see objects that emit this type of energy. This spectrum
includes gamma radiation, x-rays, and other high intensity
radiation. As a result, a character with this vision can see if
areas have a high level of background radiation. At night,
this vision allows a character to see to a distance of 300â€™.
Since this vision relies on heavy background radiation, it is
not useful underground unless there is a source of
radiation for illumination. If a mutant has ordinary vision
and ultraviolet vision, the ultraviolet vision is only usable in
darkness, and it takes 1 round to transition between each
form.
