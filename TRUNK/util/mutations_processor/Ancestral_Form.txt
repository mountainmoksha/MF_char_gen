This mental mutation can reduce an opponentâ€™s
mutational capabilities, eventually removing all forms of
mutation and returning it to its original, unadulterated
form. On each round after a successful mental attack with
this mutation, the target has one mutation removed
permanently (randomly determined), until none are left.
Rarely (5%), this power allows a powerful mutant to
regress a pure specimen further down the evolutionary
line, to a previous stage of its evolution. For example, a
pure human might become a dimmer-witted Homo
erectus, and onward. This attack may only be attempted
for the duration of one encounter, whether it succeeds or
not, and cannot be used again for 1 week.
