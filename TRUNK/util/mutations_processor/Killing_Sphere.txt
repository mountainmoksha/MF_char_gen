This powerful mutation allows the mutant to generate a
25â€™ radius sphere of deadly mental energy centered on the
mutant. Within this sphere of energy all creatures except
the mutant (friend or foe!) have their hit points reduced to
1 point, and must save versus stun attacks or be knocked
unconscious for 1d10 rounds. After using this mutation,
the mutant is exhausted from the force of the mental
exertion and may move at full rate but not attack for 2d10
rounds.
